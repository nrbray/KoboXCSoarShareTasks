# [Share Kobo task files - First time setup](./Flexi_BOS_first_time.md)
1. Connect the Kobo via USB (normal cable) to a PC that is on.
2. [Nickel] -- main menu option.  (Puts the Kobo in eBook mode.)
3. Wait for "Computer detected".  Answer "Connect".
4. Save <http://vps221852.ovh.net/FlexiBOS/KoboRoot.tgz> to the .kobo folder on the Kobo.  
5. Reboot into the XCSoar menu.
6. [Network] -- main menu option.  
7. [Wifi_ON] -- Network menu option. Wait 30 seconds until "WiFi ON" -> "Wifi OFF" and "Wifi" below goes black.
8. Do the next bit once for one WiFi hotspot and again for any additional hotspot
9. [WiFi] -- menu option. Look for your connection.  Select "Connect" and add password if needed.  "Close".
    - Sometimes it is better/quicker/works first time to go to [Nickel] -- main menu option, Ebook mode and connect to WiFi there instead, _then_ [Network] and [Wifi_ON]
10. **Before you can share tasks** I/someone else in the group will need to "accept" you: wait and check this is done

##### Then each time In XCSoar [\[Nav\]-\[Task\]-\[Manage\]-\[Browse\] on the Kobo do this to find the new task](./Flexi_BOS_Each_time)
